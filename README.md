# Linear Algebraic Portraits of Files #
This repo is thought of as a sandbox for experiments with applications 
of Proposition 5.9 (essentially Proposition 2.4 from the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02601)
from the monograph [A.O. Matveev, Symmetric Cycles](https://www.jennystanford.com/), Singapore: Jenny Stanford Publishing, 2023.

At the current moment, our modest goal is to show a not too optimized mechanism of creating the portrait (2.11)  of the 
file *Desdemona.txt*, presented in the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16135.
