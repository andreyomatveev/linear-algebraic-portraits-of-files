# Linear Algebraic Portraits of Files #
This repo is thought of as a sandbox for experiments with applications 
of Proposition 5.9 (essentially Proposition 2.4 from the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02601)
from the monograph [A.O. Matveev, Symmetric Cycles](https://www.jennystanford.com/), Singapore: Jenny Stanford Publishing, 2023.

At the current moment, our goal is to show a not too optimized mechanism of creating the exact linear algebraic portrait (2.11), called the *primary portrait*, of the file *Desdemona.txt*, presented in the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16135.

We also create three *secondary exact* (*ir*)*redundant* portraits; see the interactive note [intro_into_primary_and_secondary_portraits](https://github.com/andreyomatveev/linear-algebraic-portraits-of-files/blob/main/Linear%20Algebraic%20Portraits%20of%20Files/intro_into_primary_and_secondary_portraits.ipynb).
